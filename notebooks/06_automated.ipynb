    "## Notebook 06: Automated Weekly Digest\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "Build an automated system that discovers and analyzes AI research papers weekly without manual intervention. This transforms Radar from an on-demand tool into a continuous intelligence platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Task | Output |\n",
    "|------|------|--------|\n",
    "| 1 | **Build Digest Generator** | Python script that fetches and processes papers |\n",
    "| 2 | **Format Markdown Report** | Beautiful, scannable weekly digest document |\n",
    "| 3 | **Test Locally** | Generate sample digest for validation |\n",
    "| 4 | **Create GitHub Action** | Automated workflow definition |\n",
    "| 5 | **Configure Secrets** | Set up API keys for automation |\n",
    "| 6 | **Deploy and Schedule** | Set weekly trigger (every Monday) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions to Answer\n",
    "- How do we select the most interesting papers from 50-200 weekly results?\n",
    "- What format makes the digest most useful and readable?\n",
    "- How do we handle API rate limits and costs in automation?\n",
    "- Where should the digest be stored (GitHub, email, website)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Python script generating weekly markdown reports\n",
    "- GitHub Actions workflow running every Monday at 9am\n",
    "- Automatic commits of digest reports to repository\n",
    "- Fully autonomous research monitoring with zero manual intervention\n",

    "### Design Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency over completeness:** Process 5-10 most relevant papers deeply rather than 100 papers superficially. Focus on quality insights that save time, not overwhelming information dumps.\n",
