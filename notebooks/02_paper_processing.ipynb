    "## 📄 Notebook 02: Paper Processing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "Build a robust pipeline to download PDFs from ArXiv and extract structured text. This is critical because my agents need to analyze full papers, not just abstracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Do\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | Task | Output |\n",
    "|------|------|--------|\n",
    "| 1 | **Load Sample Data** | Reuse papers from Notebook 01 |\n",
    "| 2 | **Download PDFs** | Test batch PDF downloading | PDF files in data/raw |\n",
    "| 3 | **Extract Text** | Test PyMuPDF vs other libraries | Raw text extraction |\n",
    "| 4 | **Parse Structure** | Identify sections (Abstract, Methods, etc.) | Structured paper content |\n",
    "| 5 | **Handle Edge Cases** | Deal with equations, figures, formatting | Robust extraction |\n",
    "| 6 | **Build Pipeline Function** | Production-ready processing function | Reusable code |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions to Answer\n",
    "- What's the best library for PDF text extraction?\n",
    "- Can I reliably identify paper sections?\n",
    "- How do I handle equations and figures?\n",
    "- What error cases do I need to handle?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "- Downloaded PDFs for 10-20 sample papers\n",
    "- Clean text extraction from PDFs\n",
    "- Section identification (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion)\n",
    "- Production function: `process_paper(pdf_path) -> structured_dict`\n",
